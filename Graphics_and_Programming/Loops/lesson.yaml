  Output: "In this lesson you will learn the how and why of loops."


- Class: text
  Output: "## What Are Loops?"

- Class: text
  Output: "Looping is taking a multi-step process and automating it. 
    It allows you to 'batch' sets of repeated parts of code and cycle 
    through them. Loops are integral to all modern programming languages."

- Class: text
  Output: "There are two main types of loops: (1) The 'for' loop type 
    which exeute for a prescribed number of times and are controlled by a 
    counter or an index. (2) The 'while' or 'repeat' loop type are based on 
    verifying a logical condition which is tested at the start and/or end of 
    each loop."
    
- Class: text
  Output: "### For loops"
  
- Class: text
  Output: "Suppose you wanted to print out six sentences of the form
    'The year is [i]', where [i] is one of 2010, 2011, 2012,
    2013, 2014, and 2015."
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "We could do this with six lines of code, using the `print()` 
    and `paste()` commands, as follows: `print(paste('The year is', 2010))`.
    Try that out."
  CorrectAnswer:  print(paste('The year is', 2010))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "print(paste('The year is', 2010))")
  Hint: print(paste("The year is", 2010))  
  
- Class: text
  Output: "What is this code doing? First, the function `print()` prints 
    whatever is inside it to the console. If we ran `print('Hullo, Simon')`, 
    we would get 'Hullo, Simon' displayed in the console."
    
- Class: text
  Output: "Second, the function `paste()` is a very useful function
    for sticking bits of text together with other things (which are
    converted to text. In this case, `paste()` takes the text string
    'The year is', concatenates it with the integer 2010, and gives a 
    character/text string 'The year is 2010'."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Great! Now you only have to do that five more times ... 
    Repeat that code for the year 2011."
  CorrectAnswer:  print(paste('The year is', 2011))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "print(paste('The year is', 2011))")
  Hint: "print(paste('The year is', 2011))"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Great! Now you only have to do that four more times ...
    Repeat that code for the year 2012."
  CorrectAnswer:  print(paste('The year is', 2012))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "print(paste('The year is', 2012))")
  Hint: "print(paste('The year is', 2012))"

- Class: text
  Output: "Great! Now you only have ... just joking. But, you can see
    that it can get pretty tedious writing out the same thing/s over
    and over again, and just making one of two small changes."
    
- Class: text
  Output: "This is where the idea of the loop comes in. It allows
    us to automate this process, which makes our lives a little less tedious,
    and also removes another step where human error can creep in."
    
- Class: text
  Output: "One of the principles of programming is D.R.Y.: Don't 
    Repeat Yourself.  If we can avoid repetition, all is well.
    So, how do we construct a loop?"

- Class: text
  Output: "There are at minimum three steps to creating a loop: 
    an object to loop through, a counter, and the code that is 
    executed at each step or loop.
    First, we need a vector which we can cycle over or move through
    at each step. This vector is the part of the code that is changing 
    every time."
    
- Class: cmd_question    
  Output: "In this example, we are changing the year at every step.
    So, we need a vector of years, that goes from 2010 to 2015.  
    Create that now, but do not assign it to anything."
  CorrectAnswer: 2010:2015
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs("2010:2015", "c(2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015)")
  Hint: "The easiest way is to use ` : `" 

- Class: text
  Output: "Great, so you have a vectors of 6 years. How do we put that into
    our statement 'The year is'?
    We need to use the function `for()`. This function contains the counter
    that loops through the vector of years."
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Let's try that. To ensure the code runs, 
    we also need to add a pair of curly brackets. Type: for(i in 2010:2015){}"
  CorrectAnswer: for(i in 2010:2015){}
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'for(i in 2010:2015){}')
  Hint: Type what we told you ...
  
- Class: text
  Output: "What did we do there? Well, we have the vector we created earlier,
    of years. We also added the extra object `i`, which acts as an index. 
    We use this to link the
    counter, vector, and code we will run inside the loop. Because we are trying
    to automate the printing of years, we need some term to stand in for each year.
    We therefore use the object 'i'. The 'in' part of the code is the 
    bit that steps through each element of the vector of years."

    
- Class: text
  Output: "The function `for()` also allows you to add code after it. This 
    code will be the code that is run for each step of the loop.
    To ensure that R knows that this code is contained in the loop, it 
    should be nested within curly brackets: {}."
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Modify the code we used previously to print one year to the screen, 
    but instead of using an integer, put the
    letter 'i' (without quotes). This will link with the previous use of
    'i' inside the function `for()`.
    (And for now, do not put this code inside the curly brackets)"
  CorrectAnswer: print(paste('The year is', i))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "print(paste('The year is', i))")
  Hint: "Remember {print(paste('The year is', i))}"
    
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Great! So, now we can build the whole loop. Put all those pieces 
    together, and see what happens!"
  CorrectAnswer: for(i in 2010:2015) {print(paste('The year is', i))}
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "for(i in 2010:2015) {print(paste('The year is', i))}")
  Hint: Put all the pieces together.

- Class: text
  Output: "Let's explain that again in real words. 
    For each 'year' that is in the sequence 2010 to 2015,
    run the code chunk 
    `print(paste('The year is', i))`. 
    Once the for loop has executed the code chunk for every year (i)
    in the vector, the loop stops and goes to the first instruction 
    after the loop block."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Ok, so now try this on your own. Create a simple loop that prints
    the integers 1 to 10 to the screen. First, make a vector of integers 1 
    through 10."
  CorrectAnswer: 1:10
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs("1:10", "c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)")
  Hint: "1:10"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Now, put that in a call to `for()`, cycle through it, and 
    print each element. In other words, make the loop."
  CorrectAnswer: for(i in 1:10){print(i)}
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "for(i in 1:10){print(i)}") 
  Hint: "Remember the three elements: the for(), the vector, and the code in 
    curly brackets."
    
- Class: text
  Output: "Now that you can write simple loops, we can start expanding 
    on what they can do."
    
- Class: text
  Output: "The first thing to note is that, when you write 
    your own loops, the curly brackets can enclose many lines of code."

- Class: text
  Output: "Second, loops can be nested in loops can be nested in
    loops can be .. Much like lists, you can nest loops within loops."

- Class: text
  Output: "Third, a very useful aspect of loops is that you can use
    them to fill results into an empty vector or matrix."
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Let's try out your new skills on a real dataset. The Michigan
    tree plot data are loaded with this lesson, called `trees`. Look at the head of the 
    dataset to remind yourself."
  CorrectAnswer: head(trees)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'head(trees)')
  Hint: head(trees)
  
- Class: text
  Output: "Your task is to calculate the mean DBH for each species.
    Remember that we could do this easily with the function `tapply()`.
    We are essentially going to try and replicate that function here, 
    with a loop."
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "First, we need to set our vector to loop over. 
    This will be the names of the six different species
    in the data. Use `levels()` to obtain these, and 
    assign this vector to the object `spp`."
  CorrectAnswer: spp <- levels(trees$species)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'spp <- levels(trees$species)')
  Hint: Use levels(trees$species) and assign this to the object spp
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Check that you got all the species. Type: spp."
  CorrectAnswer: spp
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'spp')
  Hint: spp
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Now we need to work out the code we will run 
    to calculate the mean dbh. We will build this up in 
    steps. First, write code to calculate the mean
    dbh of White Oak, subsetting the trees data within 
    the call to `mean()`."
  CorrectAnswer: mean(trees$dbh[trees$species == 'whiteoak'])
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "mean(trees$dbh[trees$species == 'whiteoak'])")
  Hint: "Remember that you need to calculate the mean of 
    the dbh column, subset by the species column."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Now, we want to replace with actual name of whiteoak 
    with its' index. First, use the correct index number on 
    the spp vector to return 'whiteoak'."
  CorrectAnswer: spp[6]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'spp[6]')
  Hint: "Look at spp to find the position of whiteoak."
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Now replace the hard-coded species name with 
    that call to the index in spp in the previous call to `mean()`."
  CorrectAnswer: mean(trees$dbh[trees$species == spp[6]])
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "mean(trees$dbh[trees$species == spp[6]])")
  Hint: "whiteoak is spp[6]."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Ok, so now we can reference the spp vector to pull out 
    any particular species by index and calculate its' mean dbh.
    The next step is to store this value somewhere. Make an empty
    vector called `x`."
  CorrectAnswer: x <- vector()
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('x <- vector()', 'x <- vector(length = 6)')
  Hint: You need to use the function `vector()` There is no need to 
    specify how long.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Now, assign the mean dbh of white oak to the first element
    of this new vector, using the previous code."
  CorrectAnswer: x[1] <- mean(trees$dbh[trees$species == spp[6]])
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "x[1] <- mean(trees$dbh[trees$species == spp[6]])")
  Hint: "You will need to index x."
  
- Class: text
  Output: "Hopefully you can now see how we can pull all these 
    parts together to create the loop that will give us a vector (x)
    of the mean dbh values for all six tree species. For this code to
    run across all species, we can index both sides by the counter index (`i`) 
    rather than the specific species index."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "To acheive this, you will also need to know how to 
    count along the spp vector. The best way is to use the 
    function `length()`. How might you use this function
    to count from 1 to the number of species?"
  CorrectAnswer: 1:length(spp)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "1:length(spp)")
  Hint: 1:length(spp)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Now we have our vector to loop over (`spp`), the counter
    (`1:length(spp)`) and the code 
    (`x[i] <- mean(trees$dbh[trees$species == spp[i]])`).
    Put these parts together to loop over all size tree
    species and return the vector x that contains their mean
    dbh values."
  CorrectAnswer: for(i in 1:length(spp)){x[i] <- mean(trees$dbh[trees$species == spp[i]])}
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "for(i in 1:length(spp)){x[i] <- mean(trees$dbh[trees$species == spp[i]])}")
  Hint: "Look back at how we constructed the loop in the first two examples."

- Class: text
  Output: "Great work! You can now write loops that access real data, and
    assign the output to positions in empty objects such as vectors."
 
- Class: text
  Output: "You probably also appreciate the fact that `tapply()` is a much more useful 
    and easier to use function than maybe you thought!"
    
- Class: text
  Output: "In summary, if you need to perform an action (say) three times or more,
    then a loop *may* serve you better for several reasons:
    It makes the code more (i) compact, (ii) readable, and (iii) maintainable and you may save some typing."
    
- Class: text
  Output: "However, once you spend enough time with and reading about R, you 
     will frequently hear advice to avoid the use of loops."
     
- Class: text
  Output: "This is because R can do something that few programming
    languages can do: vectorization."
    
- Class: text
  Output: "**Vectorization** is the conversion of 
    repeated operations on simple numbers (“scalars”) into single operations
    on vectors or matrices."

- Class: text
  Output: "We have encountered this many times before, but not made note of it.
    For example, if you add to vectors of equal length (e.g., columns in a 
    data frame) you are vectorizing because R sums the two elements in each row.
    Similarly, the function `colSums()` adds up all the elements in the first 
    column before 'looping' to the next."

- Class: text
  Output: "Many instances where a loop is *required* in another programming 
    language, R will vectorize instead, or the problem can be vectorized."
    
- Class: text
  Output: "This benefit is partly because R passes all these calculations to 
    a lower-level language (C), which is much faster than the higher-level R; 
    partly because R treats even single integers as single-element vectors."

- Class: text
  Output: "Check this website for more details on vectorization: 
    http://www.noamross.net/blog/2014/4/16/vectorization-in-r--why.html"
    
- Class: text
  Output: "Either way, you will almost certainly encounter situations where
    you will need a loop."
