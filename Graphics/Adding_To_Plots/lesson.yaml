- Class: text
  Output: "Up until now, we have explored how to modify the parameters of graphs themselves, but what if we want to add extra elements 
    or text to the plot?"
    
- Class: text
  Output: "We can use many functions, including the `points()`, `lines()`, or `text()` functions to do just that.
    In all three cases, we need to provide some coordinates (x and usually y), and then provide some specific
    direction in terms of the plotting character (`pch = `), colour (`col = `), line width (`lwd = `) or 
    size (`cex = `) for points; line type (`lty = `) or line width (`lwd = `) for lines; and labels (i.e., the 
    text that goes at each coordinate, as for axis), size, colour, or font for text." 
    
- Class: text
  Output: "Before we can use these functions, however, we first need to intialize a plot to which these elements can be added."  
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Using the state dataset we loaded in this lesson for you, plot Income as a function of Illiteracy using the 'data' argument,
  but set the plot type to 'n'."
  CorrectAnswer: plot(Income ~ Illiteracy, data = state, type = 'n')
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('plot(Income ~ Illiteracy, data = state, type = "n")','plot(Income ~ Illiteracy, type = "n", data = state)')
  Hint: "Be sure to set the data = argument to your dataset so you don't have to reference the data for your variables, and set the type = 'n'"
  
- Class: text
  Output: "We currently have a blank canvas---let's use the `points()` function to begin filling it in."
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "The syntax of the `points()` function works largely like the plot function. Go ahead and add points to the plot, specifying 
  Income as a function Illiteracy with the data argument, but subset the data such that we're only plotting points where HS_grad is
  less than 50. Make these points 'red'."
  CorrectAnswer: points(Income ~ Illiteracy, data = state[state$HS_grad < 50,], col = "red")
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('points(Income ~ Illiteracy, data = state[state$HS_grad < 50,], col = "red")','points(Income ~ Illiteracy, col = "red", data = state[state$HS_grad < 50,])')
  Hint: "Use the data argument to pass your data subsetted for HS_grad < 50. Be sure to make the points red."
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Now do the same thing, but instead add points for HS_grad greater than or equal to 50. Make these points blue."
  CorrectAnswer: points(Income ~ Illiteracy, data = state[state$HS_grad >= 50,], col = "blue")
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('points(Income ~ Illiteracy, data = state[state$HS_grad >= 50,], col = "blue")','points(Income ~ Illiteracy, col = "blue", data = state[state$HS_grad >= 50,])')
  Hint: "Use the data argument to pass your data subsetted for HS_grad >= 50. Be sure to make the points blue."
  
- Class: text
  Output: "Now we can see a bit more information on our graph. Specifically, how different levels of high school graduation rates interact
  with income and illiteracy. This is one way to code colors in your figures. You will learn another in the next lesson."
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Let's now model this relationship and add a line (you've done this before). First create a linear model of Income as a 
  function of Illiteracy, being sure to set the data argument. Set this to the object m1."
  CorrectAnswer: m1 <- lm(Income ~ Illiteracy, data = state)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'm1 <- lm(Income ~ Illiteracy, data = state)')
  Hint: "m1 <- lm(Income ~ Illiteracy, data = state)"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Now, use 'abline()' with your model to add a regression line. Set the line width to 3, and the color to 'orange'."
  CorrectAnswer: abline(m1, lwd = 3, col = "orange")
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('abline(m1, lwd = 3, col = "orange")','abline(m1, col = "orange", lwd = 3)')
  Hint: "Make sure you pass m1 as the first arguement, and set the 'lwd' and 'col' arguments."
  
- Class: text
  Output: "A definite trend, but it can often be helpful to visualize just how far from zero our slope is. Lets add another abline 
  to our plot, this time creating a horizontal line across our plot as a reference. Instead of giving the function an intercept and 
  slope, we can instead specify either an 'h' or 'v' argument, meaning horizontal or vertical respectively. This will create a 
  straight line on either the y or x axis, at the value specified."
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Using `abline()`, set a horizontal line at the mean of our Income variable (do this programatically). Set the line width to 
  3 again, and the change the line type to a dashed line (check the par help file to see how)."
  CorrectAnswer: abline(h = mean(state$Income), lwd = 3, lty = 2)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('abline(h = mean(state$Income), lwd = 3, lty = 2)','abline(h = mean(state$Income), lty = 2, lwd = 3)')
  Hint: "Remember that we can find the mean directly with mean(state$Income). Check the 'lty' argument in par() to create a dashed line."

- Class: text
  Output: "Nice! There will be many times in your figure-making career when you might want to add a useful visual baseline or reference
  to emphasize a trend."
  
- Class: text
  Output: "Suppose we really want to visualize where one state in particular, maybe Connecticut,
  lies in this relationship. We can do so by adding text at the location of the point associated with CT."
  
- Class: text
  Output: "At its simplest, the `text()` function takes a label (your text), and places it at a specified
  x,y coordinate on the plot."
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Lets do it! Using a subset of 'state', assign to the object 'x' the Illiteracy value
  for Connecticut."
  CorrectAnswer: x <- state$Illiteracy[state$state_name == "Connecticut"]
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('x <- state$Illiteracy[state$state_name == "Connecticut"]','x <- state[state$state_name == "Connecticut", "Illiteracy"]')
  Hint: "Use a subset of 'state' to extract the value. Be sure that you're subsetting the row for the 
  state Connecticut, and calling the Illiteracy column."
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Now do the same for 'y', creating the object from the Income value for Connecticut (by 
  subsetting 'state')."
  CorrectAnswer: y <- state$Income[state$state_name == "Connecticut"]
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('y <- state$Income[state$state_name == "Connecticut"]','y <- state[state$state_name == "Connecticut", "Income"]')
  Hint: "Use a subset of 'state' to extract the value. Be sure that you're subsetting the row for the 
  state Connecticut, and calling the Income column."
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Now, call the 'text' function, giving it x, y, and your label 'Connecticut'. Scale the text 
  down by 0.75."
  CorrectAnswer: text(x, y, 'Connecticut', cex = 0.75)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('text(x, y, "Connecticut", cex = 0.75)','text(x, y, labels = "Connecticut", cex = 0.75)','text(x = x, y = y, labels = "Connecticut", cex = 0.75)')
  Hint: "text(x, y, 'Connecticut', cex = 0.75)"

- Class: text
  Output: "Nice work! Lets add one more detail to the graph. We happen to know what the colors of each
  point represents, but someone else reviewing your figure might not, so lets include a legend."
  
- Class: text
  Output: "The 'legend' function, much like the other functions we've been playing around with,
  adds elements to a figure after the initial figure has been drawn."
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Enter the following code: legend('topright', legend = c('HS Grad Rate < 50', 'HS Grad Rate >= 50'), col = c('red','blue'), pch = 1, cex = 0.75, bty = 'n')"
  CorrectAnswer: legend('topright', legend = c('HS Grad Rate < 50', 'HS Grad Rate >= 50'), col = c('red','blue'), pch = 1, cex = 0.75, bty = 'n')
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'legend("topright", legend = c("HS Grad Rate < 50", "HS Grad Rate >= 50"), col = c("red","blue"), pch = 1, cex = 0.75, bty = "n")')
  Hint: legend('topright', legend = c('HS Grad Rate < 50', 'HS Grad Rate >= 50'), col = c('red','blue'), pch = 1, cex = 0.75, bty = 'n')

- Class: text
  Output: "While we could specify an exact x,y location of the legend, the function accepts some handy keywords that
  automatically justify it to generalized location in your plot, like topleft, topright, etc... The 'legend' 
  argument represents the name of each legend entry, col and pch are the styles for each entry, and 'bty = 'n' 
  tells R that we don't want a box around the legend."
  
- Class: text
  Output: "Lets practice once more with the `segments()` function. You will need this function 
  frequently in any scenario in which you need to display error bars (often with bar charts and strip charts)."
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "We have a variable in state called 'Murder_qual', representing whether the murder rate in each state
  is qualitatively considered high or low. Create an object called bar1 using `tapply()` to find the mean number
  of frost days using 'Murder_qual' as the index."
  CorrectAnswer: bar1 <- tapply(state$Frost, state$Murder_qual, mean)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('bar1 <- tapply(state$Frost, state$Murder_qual, mean)','bar1 <- tapply(X = state$Frost, INDEX = state$Murder_qual, FUN = mean)')
  Hint: Remember tapply takes three primary arguments, X is your data, INDEX is the variable you wish to split your data on, and FUN is the function to use. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Now use `barplot()` to plot 'bar1', but set the y-axis range from 0 to 180 to leave room for our error bars.
  Save the plot as an object called 'bar_loc' (to save the x locations of each bar)."
  CorrectAnswer: bar_loc <- barplot(bar1, ylim = c(0,180))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'bar_loc <- barplot(bar1, ylim = c(0,180))')
  Hint: bar_loc <- barplot(bar1, ylim = c(0,180))

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Now we need to calculate our sample standard error. R does not have a base function for this, but
  we have created our own with this lesson called `std_error()`. Use `tapply()` on the same data and index, but find
  the standard error instead of the mean. Call the object 'bar1_se'."
  CorrectAnswer: bar1_se <- tapply(state$Frost, state$Murder_qual, std_error)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('bar1_se <- tapply(state$Frost, state$Murder_qual, std_error)','bar1_se <- tapply(X = state$Frost, INDEX = state$Murder_qual, FUN = std_error)')
  Hint: Remember tapply takes three primary arguments, X is your data, INDEX is the variable you wish to split your data on, and FUN is the function to use. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Now enter the following code: `segments(x0 = bar_loc, y0 = bar1 + bar1_se*2, x1 = bar_loc, y1 = bar1 - bar1_se*2)`"
  CorrectAnswer: segments(x0 = bar_loc, y0 = bar1 + bar1_se*2, x1 = bar_loc, y1 = bar1 - bar1_se*2)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'segments(x0 = bar_loc, y0 = bar1 + bar1_se*2, x1 = bar_loc, y1 = bar1 - bar1_se*2)')
  Hint: segments(x0 = bar_loc, y0 = bar1 + bar1_se*2, x1 = bar_loc, y1 = bar1 - bar1_se*2)

- Class: text
  Output: "Segments requires 4 arguments, a starting x point (`x0 = `), a starting y point (`y0 = `), an ending x point (`x1 = `) and an
  ending y point (`y1 = `). From these 4 values it can draw a line between the starting and ending coordinates. Further, if we give `segments()`
  a vector of values for each of these arguments, it will draw a segment for each entry in the vector (as we've done
  above)."
  
- Class: text
  Output: "For each segment, the starting and ending x values of the segment are just the centers of each bar (bar_loc). 
  The starting and ending points of the y values are plus and minus 2 standard errors of our sample (2 standard 
  errors correspond roughly to the 95% confidence interval)."

- Class: text
  Output: "Finally, so far we have just placed one plot or pane in each graphics window. 
    However, in many cases you will want multiple similar plots side-by-side, or different
    kinds of plots in the same overall figure. There are 
    several ways to do this, but the easiest way to create a set of equal-size panels
    is to use a call to `par()`. There are two arguments here, `mfrow = ` and `mfcol = '."
    
- Class: text
  Output: "You use one of these arguments to set up the grid of panels, which you then fill,
    one-by-one, with separate uses of `plot()` (other which ever plotting function you want). 
    **Note** If you plot more figures than the number of panels available, they will start to overwrite from the beginning."

- Class: text
  Output: "As we said, `par()` has two similar arguments: `mfrow` and `mfcol`. Both arguments take a vector of the
    form `c(number of rows, number of columns)`."
    
- Class: text
  Output: "Using `mfcol` fills this grid by colums, using `mfrow` fills by rows. For example,
  `par(mfrow = c(2, 2))` creates a graphics window with four panels, in a 2 x 2 layout."
  
- Class: text
  Output: "`par(mfcol = c(4, 1))` creates a column of four panels."
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "OK.. now for the finale. Our quest is to make a figure with two graphs, side-by-side, the first 
    being a scatterplot and the second a boxplot. First, use a call to `par()` to set the plotting window
    to a two-by-two pane grid. You can use either `mfrow = ` or `mfcol =`."
  CorrectAnswer: par(mfrow = c(2,2))
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('par(mfrow = c(2,2))', 'par(mfcol = c(2,2))')
  Hint: You need to pass a vector of two elements to one of mfrow or mfcol, within par().


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "In theory, nothing should have changed in your plot window. R has secretly set up
    the grid, but is waiting a call to `plot()`. Plot the first graph, which in this case is Income
    as a function of Illiteracy. Plot this normally (dont supress the output with 'type'). 
    However, set the axis labels to bold font."
  CorrectAnswer: plot(Income ~ Illiteracy, data = state, font.lab = 2)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='plot(Income ~ Illiteracy, data = state, font.lab = 2)')
  Hint: Be sure to use the data argument, and check ?par if you need helping changing the label font.
  
- Class: text
  Output: "For some reason that we cannot work out, swirl plots two figures each
    time we call `plot()`, which does not happen in regular R. So, don't worry about that:
    it's why we have a 2x2 grid!"

- Class: text
  Output: "If things do not look quite right, you may still end up with a plot. 
    Running another call to `plot()` will add in the second pane, so you may need several 
    tries to get things looking correct, and also to have that correct graph in the first pane.
    That is fine.. you are learning to use R in an interactive and interative way; well done!"
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Now, add the second pane, a boxplot of HS_grad, with the box colour set to red and
    the y-axis numbers horizontal."
  CorrectAnswer: boxplot(state$HS_grad, col = 'red', las = 1)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='boxplot(state$HS_grad, col = "red", las = 1)')
  Hint: boxplot(state$HS_grad, col = 'red', las = 1)


- Class: text
  Output: "Well done! Learning to modify graphics is even more detailed than regular R, and usually
    requires extensive use of the help files. Check this page for more details and examples
